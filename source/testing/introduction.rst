Introduction
=============================

As a sender of signature jobs, you have the option of testing in our public test environment [#difitest]_. 

No identities of real persons are available to use for logging in, nor signing, in the public test environment. The various identity providers (:ref:`testing-bankid`, ID-porten) offer creating mock identities to use in their test environments, which will work with the test environments of Posten signering. In our public test environment, any activity involving personal identities (logging in on the web site, signing documents) must use mock persons to simulate the identities, as no real persons are available outside of the production environment. **I.e. you can not use your own personal BankID to sign in the public test environment.**

Please keep any mock persons you create in your own records for reuse, to avoid having to create a lot of persons which ends up unused.

See also `signering.posten.no/virksomhet <https://signering.posten.no/virksomhet>`_ on how to get started with signing up as a business and sender of signature jobs.
