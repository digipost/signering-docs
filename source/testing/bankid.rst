BankID
===================

This is how you can create "mock" persons in BankID's test environment, which will then work with Posten signering's test environment.

- Go to https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#!/generate
- Click "Generate number" button
- Type a name, and leave "BankID TestBank" as checked
- Click "Order" button

When done, the new test person can be used with BankID in the test environment using the default one time password ``otp`` and password ``qwer1234``.
